    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 quart heavy whipping cream</li>
      <li>1 cup powdered sugar</li>
      <li>One 9-ounce box thin chocolate wafer cookies</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In the bowl of an electric mixer using a whisk attachment, whisk the
        heavy cream and powdered sugar until stiff.
      </li>
      <li>
        Crush one-third of the wafers by hand or with a rolling pin inside a
        resalable plastic bag until they become coarse crumbs. Set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a round 9-inch springform pan, layer in one-third of the whipped
        cream, smoothing evenly with a spatula. Then layer half of the remaining
        flat whole wafers close to each other, then one-third more of the
        whipped cream, then the remaining whole wafers and finally top with the
        rest of the whipped cream. Garnish the top of cake with the crushed
        wafers.
      </li>
      <li>Cover and refrigerate for at least 6 hours.</li>
      <li>
        Run a paring knife around the springform pan and release the wall of the
        pan from around the cake. Leave the cake on the bottom of the pan and
        transfer to a serving dish or cake stand, then slice and serve.
      </li>
    </ol>
